# Generator-TCG

A command line utility for The Control Group split testing team. An existing directory (the default variation) is cloned and renamed with the desired prefix and suffix. The new files will then serve as a variation against which the control will be tested.

This tool assumes that the user will navigate to the `funnel/` directory before running any commands.

### How to Use:

When the command "yo tcg" is executed, the user must answer three questions. Here's an example of how one might answer:

* **What section are you working on?** [report-review]
* **Which directory do you wish to copy?** [ga-33]
* **What would you like to call it?** [jc-01]

The answers above will result in `ga/ga-33` (the folders and all files within) being duplicated and renamed to `jc/jc-01`. The parent directories ("ga" and "jc") are derived from "ga-33" and "jc-01", respectively, by grabbing the part of the string that precedes the hyphen. TCG's current naming convention is enforced: user's initials (two letters), a hyphen, and 2-3 numbers.

### Existing Features:

* The default variation is cloned into the appropriate directory/sub-directory (which is created if it doesn't yet exist) and all files are renamed according to the desired namespace and suffix.
* Hidden files are prevented from being copied and renamed (.DS_Store, for example).
* User input validation.
* Cloning is prevented when the subdirectory already exists.
* User is alerted when she attempts to copy a directory that does not exist.

### Future Features:

- [ ] Create the appropriate subdirectory dynamically (numerically speaking). This would prevent us from having to input the desired suffix manually because it would find the subdirectory with the highest numerical value and then rename the duplicated directory (and the files within) with the **next** numerical value. If the most recent file name is `jc-44.js`, the program will create `jc-45.js`.
- [ ] Find a way to eliminate `setTimeout()`.
- [ ] The error message that appears when the directory doesn't exist should appear sooner.
- [ ] Add an optional flag to generate a dummy directory structure in order to facilitate testing.
