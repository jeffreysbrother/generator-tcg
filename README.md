# This is a work in progress!

come back later...

Still need:

* all individual files renamed
* check if namespaced dir already exists, check which subfolders already exist and create the appropriate one (numerically speaking)
* rename .jsrc to .js? But sometimes both files exist!
* find a way to convert .jsrc file contents to ES6!
