# Generator-TCG

A command line utility for The Control Group split testing team. An existing directory (the default variation) is cloned and renamed with the desired prefix and suffix.

This tool assumes that the user will navigate to the *funnel/source/sections/<section>* directory before running any commands.

### Existing Features:

* rename `.jsrc` files to `.js`
* prevent hidden files from being copied and renamed
* cloning is prevented when subdirectory already exists

### Future Features:

* create the appropriate subdirectory (numerically speaking) dynamically.
* What if both .jsrc AND .js files exist?
  * if .jsrc and .js exist OR if only .js exists, do nothing.
  * if only .jsrc exists, convert to .js.
  * if neither exist, print a message: "No JSRC or JS files exist!"
* convert to ES6 syntax?
  * possibly with [this plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify)
* modify so commands can be executed from the *funnel* directory.
